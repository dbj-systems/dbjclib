### Motivation

DBJ are an Imagined Company. They use C++, but very often with no exceptions, no `<iostream>` and no std lib.

For the latest & interesting material on "Why C", perhaps one can observe the FUSHIA Zircon Kernel material.

We do (mainly) agree with the roles of [C and C++ described in there](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/languages/c-cpp/cxx). And that is not the only team saying so.

### Testing

That part is in the `sampling` folder. Files under that folder are not part of the library.

Testing [README](sampling/readme.md) is available.

### Building

This is CLANG 9.x, C LIB made and used by Visual Studio 2019 clang 9.x as packaged with it.

Last several years basically Visual Studio and UCRT teams, are almost denying any C involvement when talking about CL. Thus for us  CLANG + Visual Studio is the C compiler we use.
