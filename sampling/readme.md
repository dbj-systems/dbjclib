## Testing

> Testing framework used is [µnit](https://nemequ.github.io/munit/)

**µnit** is not perfect. Nothing is. µnit API by default takes a lot of code to create, register and integrate each test functions, test function arrays then suites etc. 

I have added just 4 extremely simple macros which you can find in dbjclib.c

### Using

Building the tests is done from Visual Code, not from Visual Studio. Assumption is since you are 
here you know how to do this. And you know how to follow the things through a debugger using V.Code.

Reason is: Using V.Code it is much simpler to play with compilation options and run time CLI arguments, v.s. clicking through the Visual Studio GUI for the same purpose.

### CLI 

This builds into one console app. CLI is not trivial. [See the command line args available here](https://nemequ.github.io/munit/#running-tests)
